Data-Efficient Massive Tool Retrieval: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Query-Tool Alignment with Language Models

## Background

The current approach to solving tool-based problems involves first addressing the (a) massive tool retrieval (MTR) task, followed by completing the (b) tool selection task. We focus on providing a solution for the MTR task. For
evaluation, we introduce a new MTRB benchmark. Method-ologically, we propose a new QTA framework to enhance the
retrieval systems by aligning user queries with tools.
